-Hi how are you doing my name's Angel and welcome to my repository! I'm throwing all my effort on the job hunt right now and hopefully you're a recruiter checking out 
my page, I really appreciate you taking the time to do so. I've got a lot on my plate right now but I hope that the work I've done on this page helps my chances.

-I want to direct your attention to the NU World Cup website repository, that's where I really cut my teeth with web development in particular understanding javascript
and bootstrap. While I have since finished my tenure as NU World Cups tech chair I still hold a lot of pride in the fact that I spearheaded the new design of the website
making it much more accessible and visually appealing. 

-I can't show it on this repository but I also worked at a Chicago based startup called Foodboss and further developed myself by programming in a professional setting. 
In this context I learned a bit more about webscraping and using selenium to develop a comprehensive set of automated unit tests in my quality assurance position. 

-Also locked in this repository is my machine learning coursework which I'd be happy to share with anyone who's interested. I had to learn how to implement several algorithms
from scratch and this is what filled up my junior year summer in lieu of the internship offer that I had rescinded.
